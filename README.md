BACKGROUND

Slot machine is a game of chance for its customers. The machine is also known as a one-armed bandit because of the large mechanical lever affixed to the side, which in many cases is what makes the slots spin. This machine version with the lever was how it was originally assembled.

The first slot machine was called "gambling machine", and it was created in Brooklyn, New York by Sittman and Pitt in 1891. It contained five drums holding a total of 50 card faces and was based on poker. So it would give you poker hands every time you played. It became extremely popular.

After that many variations were created, such as the fruit machine, which is a slot machine but it slots have fruit images. It is usually seen in Britain.

Slot machines are the most popular game in casions and they are approximately 70% of the average U.S. casino's income.


DESCRIPTION

This is a digital slot Machine - the kind you may find in Atlantic City &/or Las Vegas, without the spinning/rolling feature. It is a browser-based game that was developed to put in practice many of the concepts learned in class.

In this specific case, the slots are only showing random values generated everytime the user presses the button "PLAY".

The random value is generated by a function, and the value is no bigger than the quantity of "emojis" that are shown in the slots. In this case there is 4 "emojis".

"üé©", "üè°", "üòë", "ü¶Ñ"

Every time the user get 3 slots with the same "emoji" , the user wins. Any other time is a loss.

There is no trick or strategy around this game to win. This is a game of chance. 

In this game, there are 3 slots, with 4 symbols each. So the total number of possible combinations is 4*4*4 = 64 combinations. 

There are 4 winning combinations out of the total 64. So the fair probability of winning this game is:

Number of winning combinations / Number of possible combinations = 4/64 

= 0.0156.

In other words, 0.0156 are the odds of winning this game with the current set up.
